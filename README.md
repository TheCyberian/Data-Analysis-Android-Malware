# Data Analysis on Android Malware Datasets
The code in this repository consists of three different R scripts.

First is data_cleanup.R which reads the data sets from *archive* folder, then loads them into data frames. These data frames are then explored and cleaned up for data analysis by removing unnecessary/unused data.

Second is data_visualization_permissions.R which creates visualization from the Android Permissions data set. The visualizations used are bar plot and word clouds.

Third and final script is data_visualization_net_traffic.R which contains the code for manipulation and analysis of the network traffic data set.The visualization used for this are bar plots, box plot, heatmap and scatter plots.

The plots generated by these scripts were exported with RStudio and have been placed under *plots* folder.
